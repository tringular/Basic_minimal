# Sternstunden

## Idea

Processes of stopping, pausing and sustaining 

I believe in the equality of all beings and a holistic, body and mind altering approach as key towards a future worth living. 

## Manifestation

Sternstunden make basic Shiatsu practice and creative conversation accessible to everyone.

By means of single sessions, workshops and podcast series to listen to (coming sson) I contribute to the development of a healthy and balanced environment with the individual at it's centre. 

### Shiatsu

Shiatsu is a flowing massage originating in Japan. It has positive effects on your wellbeing by balancing your energy system. 

In a regular Shiatsu session your body receives treatment by means of the practitioner's weight through her palms and thumbs. Depending on your individual need the treatment works from your surfacing tissues deep into your subconscious mind, thereby helping to heal what needs to be healed.

Each treatment is unique and evolves during the session. 

You may pay what you can or want (recommendation: 45 EUR per 60 minutes).

- **LANGUAGE** mind over matter, collective consciousness, media
- **GROWTH** degrowth, zero growtn, spiritual growth, growth mindset enabling technology

The school has changed me in how I interact in day-to-day as well as
