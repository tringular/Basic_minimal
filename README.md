## Bringing Shiatsu & Flowers - by Mirja Bastian

Shiatsu & Flowers aims to make basic Shiatsu practice (Shiatsu) and creative conversation (Flowers) accessible to everyone.

By means of single sessions, workshops and podcast series (to be announced) I contribute to the development of a healthy and balanced environment with the individual at it's centre. 

### Shiatsu

Shiatsu is a flowing massage originating in Japan that has positive effects on your wellbeing by balancing your energy system.
