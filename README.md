## Bringing Shiatsu & Flowers - by Mirja Bastian

Shiatsu & Flowers aims to make basic Shiatsu practice (Shiatsu) and creative conversation (Flowers) accessible to everyone.

By means of single sessions, workshops and podcast series (to be announced) I contribute to the development of a healthy and balanced environment with the individual at it's centre. 

I believe in the equality of all beings and a holistic, mind altering approach as key towards a future worth living. 

### Shiatsu

Shiatsu is a flowing massage originating in Japan that has positive effects on your wellbeing by balancing your energy system. 

In a regular Shiatsu session your body receives treatment by means of the practitioner's weight through her palms and thumbs. Depending on your individual need the treatment may work from your surfacing tissues deep into your subconscious mind, thereby helping to heal what needs to be healed.

Each treatment is unique and evolves during the session. 

You may pay what you can or want (recommendation: 45 EUR per 60 minutes). 
Book your session sending an e-mail to me@mirja.biz . 

### Flowers

Flowers stand for creative stories and conversations. By our language we create our future, so we talk about and in ways that mark a positive outlook. 

Yet to come I am conducting workshops and podcasts around the topics health, society and the environment.
