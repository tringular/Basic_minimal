## Bringing Shiatsu & Flowers - by Mirja Bastian

Shiatsu & Flowers aims to make basic Shiatsu practice (Shiatsu) and creative conversation (Flowers) accessible to everyone.

By means of single sessions, workshops and podcast series (to be announced) I contribute to the development of a healthy and balanced environment with the individual at it's centre. 

I believe in the equality of all beings and a holistic, mind and body altering approach towards a future worth living for all of us.

### Shiatsu

Shiatsu is a flowing massage originating in Japan that has positive effects on your wellbeing by balancing your energy system. 

In a regular Shiatsu session your body receives treatment by means of the practitioner's weight through her palms and thumbs. Depending on your individual need the treatment may work from your surfacing tissues deep into your subconscious mind, thereby helping to heal what needs to be healed.
