### Shiatsu

Shiatsu is a flowing massage originating in Japan. It has positive effects on wellbeing by balancing the energy system. 

In a Shiatsu session the client receives treatment by means of the practitioner's weight through her palms and thumbs. Depending on individual needs the treatment works from the surfacing tissues deep into the subconscious mind, thereby helping to heal what needs to be healed.

Each treatment is unique and evolves during the session. 

You may pay what you can or want (recommendation: 45 EUR per 60 minutes).

### About

After kick-starting a meaningless carreer I was increasingly caught by a subtle feeling of sorrow and unconsciouness to a point where I had to stop to figure out what I am willing to actively drive forward in my life and in the lives of others. Since that time I am practicing Shiatsu and thereby learned about the ego as the center of command, control and judgement in each of us as individuals and in our society. I began to believe, that the ego is the trouble-maker and needs healing. The school unfolded a spiritual growth path and changed the way I am interacting in my personal and business relationships in my job as a consultant and people lead.
